## About This Tutorial

This tutorial walks you through creating a **small, handmade academic website** using **Neocities**, basic **HTML**, and a **single CSS stylesheet**.

The goal is *not* to build a “perfect” website, nor to rely on platforms or templates that hide how the web works. Instead, this exercise focuses on **learning by doing**: writing simple code, seeing immediate results, and understanding how structure and style come together to form a site. Also this is *FUN* at least I think so :)

## What You’ll Build

You will create a straightforward academic web presence with pages for:

- a homepage  
- a CV  
- publications  
- teaching  
- projects  
- contact information  

All pages will share the same layout and design, controlled by **one CSS file**.

You will copy and paste code directly into Neocities, edit it in the browser, and watch your site take shape in real time.

## Why Neocities?

This approach is deliberately **small-scale and transparent**.

Neocities gives you full control over your files, avoids advertising and supports long-term preservation of web content. It also makes the underlying structure of the web visible:

- files  
- links  
- folders  
- stylesheets  

—not dashboards or hidden settings.

## What You’ll Learn

You do **not** need prior experience with HTML or CSS to complete this tutorial. You will be introduced to:

- basic HTML tags  
  *(headings, paragraphs, lists, links)*

- semantic page structure  
  *(header, navigation, main content, footer)*

- external CSS for styling  
  *(text, layout, spacing, colour)*

While we will review concepts together during the session, this page is designed as a **quick reference** you can return to later. You can work through it at your own pace, copy sections as needed, and adapt the site structure for your own academic or creative work.

---

## By the End of This Tutorial

You will have:

- a live website hosted on Neocities  
- a basic understanding of how HTML and CSS interact  
- a foundation you can extend, personalize, and preserve over time  

Think of this site as a **starting point**, not a finished product —  
a *handmade academic home on the small web*.
